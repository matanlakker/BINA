# README - AI Project on COVID-19 Severity Prediction

## Project Overview
This project compares different approaches for predicting the severity of COVID-19 cases based on **tabular clinical data (symptoms, age, gender)** and **radiographic lung images**. The research investigates whether tabular data models or image-based models provide better accuracy.

The following models were tested:

- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.

- **Deep Learning Models:** ANN, CNN, and Transfer Learning (ResNet50).

## **Model Performance Results**

### **Tabular Data Models**
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|---|---|---|---|
| Random Forest | 26.99% | 27% | 27% |
| Logistic Regression | 32.91% | 33% | 33% |
| Decision Tree | 32.24% | 32% | 32% |

### **Image-Based Models**
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|---|---|---|---|
| CNN | 67.3% | 69.8% | 68.5% |
| Transfer Learning (ResNet50) | 70% | 72.5% | 70% |

## **Conclusions & Recommendations**
- **Transfer Learning (ResNet50) performed best** compared to other models.

- **Image-based models achieved significantly better results** than tabular models.

- **Larger datasets are required** to further improve performance.

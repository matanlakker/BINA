# README - AI Project on COVID-19 Severity Prediction

## Project Overview
This project investigates different approaches for predicting the severity of COVID-19 cases based on both tabular clinical data and radiographic lung images. Various models were developed and evaluated:

- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Transfer Learning using ResNet50.

Findings indicate that image-based models, particularly those leveraging Transfer Learning with ResNet50, achieved the highest accuracy (70%), whereas models based on tabular data performed significantly worse (32%-33%).
